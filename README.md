# Hello there, I'm Anton! 👋

## This is a personal portfolio website developed by me using ReactJS and hosted on GitHub Pages.

I'm a developer who focuses on Quality Assurance with 9+ years of experience in the tech industry. Unlike traditional QAs, I approach testing with a developer's mindset, writing code and building systems from the ground up. My specialties include building QA teams from scratch, creating robust automation frameworks with clean architecture, orchestrating CI/CD processes with Docker and Kubernetes, and improving product quality across various sectors. With programming expertise in TypeScript, Java, C#, and Python, I bring a unique blend of development skills and testing expertise to deliver high-quality software.
